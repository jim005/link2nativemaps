# link2nativemaps
Script PHP to redirect to native map apps.

In our website, email, sms... we could forward users to url like this 
    http://maps.appsenso.eu/?q=44.533744,6.471383
so on mobile devices they are redirected to their native maps apps. Otherwise, they're redirecting to OpenStreetMap.org.

# Live demo & webservice
This script is used here http://maps.appsenso.eu
Feel free to use it. Exemple :
 * http://maps.appsenso.eu/?q=44.533744,6.471383

# Install on your server
